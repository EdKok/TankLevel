# SensESP Project for BlackWaterTank

Sensor used is a VL53L0X which can be bought from AdaFruit or AliExpress for a few dollars. It uses a laser to measure distance to the surface in mm.
Mine has a 'lens' to make it waterproof, hopefully. The disadvantage of this lens is that it is less accurate and needs an offset.
This project has only been tested on my bench.
